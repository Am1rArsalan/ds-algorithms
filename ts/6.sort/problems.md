## Problem 1: Quick Sort

**Description:** Quick Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: `[4, 2, 9, 6, 23, 12, 34, 0]`
  Output: `[0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 23, 34]`

## Problem 2: Find Kth Largest Element

**Description:** Given an unsorted array, find the kth largest element in sorted order, not necessarily distinct. This problem is often solved using various sorting algorithms or specialized techniques.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: `[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`, `k = 3`
  Output: `3` (The 3rd largest element in sorted order is `3`)

## Problem 3: Bubble Sort

**Description:** Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`
  Output: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`

## Problem 4: Insertion Sort

**Description:** Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through each element and 'inserts' it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: `[7, 3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`
  Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`

## Problem 5: Merge Sort

**Description:** Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: `[6, 2, 8, 4, 1, 9, 3, 7]`
  Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

These enhanced problem descriptions, along with the provided test cases, should help clarify each problem and its respective solution approach.
